# output-budget.sh — run a command quietly, keep everything, and refuse a run
# that prints more than it is allowed to.
#
# VENDORED from antimatter-studios/fs-linux-test-harness, scripts/output-budget.sh.
# This repository is not a consumer of that harness — it has no VM, no fixtures
# and no sibling pin to check the harness out with — so it carries its own copy
# rather than growing a `chore siblings` for one file. Keep the two in step: if
# you change the contract here (the flags, the exit statuses, FLTH_VERBOSE),
# change it there, and say so in both.
#
#   output-budget.sh --log FILE [--max-lines N] [--max-bytes N] [--tail N]
#                    [--label TEXT] -- COMMAND [ARG...]
#
#   --log FILE     where the whole run is written (created; its directory too)
#   --max-lines N  refuse a run whose output exceeds N lines   (default: none)
#   --max-bytes N  refuse a run whose output exceeds N bytes   (default: none)
#   --tail N       lines of the log to show when the command fails (default 40)
#   --label TEXT   what to call the run in the summary line (default: the command)
#   --verbose      stream the output as it happens as well as logging it;
#                  also set by FLTH_VERBOSE=1. Budgets are still enforced.
#
# WHY A BUDGET IS A TEST. A passing run that prints three thousand lines hides
# the twenty that matter, and every reader pays for it: a person scrolling, a
# CI log viewer, and an agent working in the repository, which re-reads its
# whole transcript on each step and so pays for one verbose run many times
# over. Measured on this constellation: 4,661M cache-read tokens against 9.5M
# of output, and command output was the largest single contributor that a
# repository controls. "Keep it quiet" as a convention rots in a week; as a
# number that fails the build it does not.
#
# The budget is not a gag. Everything goes to --log, the path is printed, and
# a failure prints the tail of it, so nothing is lost by making the terminal
# quiet.
#
# EXIT STATUS is the command's own, except that a breached budget exits 65
# when the command itself succeeded — a run that passed but would not fit is
# still a failure, and one you can tell apart from a failing suite.
